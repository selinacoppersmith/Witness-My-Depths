there's been a lot of death near me lately. i’m finding that grief can be a moving force.
<br/>
<br/>
.
<br/>
<br/>
i consider myself. i think, *it can't be my time yet.* 

and why not?

*because i have things to say.*

*because i'm not ready yet.*

*because i have so much more to give, i am certain.*

and yet, time passes.

how long will the universe wait for me?

i imagine how disappointed i'd be if i were to go tomorrow,
how much i would have left inside of me. traces, passed along to everyone else.

things happen, you know. it's not my time yet, i know. but <br/>
you never know.

i think about what i can do now, after i catch the pesky *what have you been doing all this time? why haven't you done anything yet?*

so here I am.

i don’t know when this project will be done. but i’ve decided our journey here can’t wait, and should not be hidden. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Vin, you have been such a force of change in my life. i’m so grateful to have known you, for the little time we had. <br/>
Rest easy. I'll carry you with me.
