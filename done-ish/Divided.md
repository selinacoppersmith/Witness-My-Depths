Divided 

some people take comfort in numbers 

two plus two is  
four  
minus two is two.  
simple. constant it does not waver. 

others can't quite make sense of math 

they see how one plus one doesn't always   
add up.   
sometimes it equals  
three.  
or five,   
and then later,   
six.  

twenty-three years ago, one and one made  
three   
and though the sum has been divided in   
two, 

i am still whole.

â€¦but i wasn't whole, was i? 

i was a cracked shell.  
careful and afraid as a child  
who has learned safety is earned. 

*"sometimes i get onto y'all even when you're doing everything right. gotta keep you on your toes."*  

*"i'm right. even if i'm wrong, i'm right."*

*several weeks of silence,* 

<!-- [which, actually, was probably preferred.] note: i kind of want this sentiment captured but not sure this is it lol, give it more or remove it-->

i simplified the math a little, what does an estranged step father work out to?  

adhd. depression. cptsd.  
my lifetime companions.  
i hope to see you less and less. 

i hope to see me more and more.
