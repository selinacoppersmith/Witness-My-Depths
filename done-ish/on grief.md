*on grief* 
 
the grief feels never ending. uncovering new layers every time i think the last stone has been turned. my self-portrait has morphed into a mosaic. i peel away the pieces and am left with something raw, tender. my entire being, a scab removed too soon.  
 
and still, the world turns. time passes, a precious gift that sometimes feels like a curse. a necessary element to the homemade healing balm for your heart, soul. it cannot be rushed.  
 
take each moment as it comes, gather your ingredients. a few autumn leaves, the melody of your new favorite song. the sound of a friend's laughter, the warmth of a loving embrace. a sunbeam from a peaceful spring morning, the scent of a rose you stopped to smell. some tears, of course.  
 
patiently, lovingly, craft your balm with friends. with shoulders you've leaned on. they will sprinkle care, they will bear witness. their memories, a time capsule. snapshots of your ever-progressing portrait. it has been you the whole time.  
 
you have been a marvel the whole time.
