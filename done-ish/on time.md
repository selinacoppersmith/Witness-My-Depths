*on time* 
 
another year has passed  
and here i am, marveling, asking,  
as all who came before me have asked,  
"where has the time gone?"  
 
but oh, time, what an exquisite gift  
of opportunity,  
of moments  
for the taking,  
for the giving,  
of happiness, sadness, joy, and grief  
of love, and heartache, and longing,  
and peace  
 
the chance to discover colors not yet seen, flavors not yet tasted  
to learn that every time your world ends, it will begin again  
 
gaining depth with every moment lived  
realizing, happiness  
is not the only flavor worth tasting  
that sometimes, even sadness is worth savoring  
 
i am the fine wine and the wine taster  
drinking in the complexity,  
the simplicity,  
the vibrancy,  
the nuance  
of living,  
of what it feels like  
to be alive  
 
oh, time, thank you for the gift.  
every year i find more of the beauty i know has always been there  
and the courage to appreciate it, to love it, to savor it all.
