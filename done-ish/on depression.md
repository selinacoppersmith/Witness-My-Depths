*on depression*

it's okay to feel hopeless sometimes. the moments will come and go. just as joy does.

the depressive state is seductive when you've spent a lot of time there.

you settle into the well worn groove, it comforts you in its misery.

this is what it feels like to be you, remember?  
these are the moments that make up eternity

they stretch,  
and stretch,  
and stretch,  
and  
go nowhere.

and it's such a relief, isn't it, to just sit?  

isn't it such a relief, to finally lay down again?  

.  

. 

. 
 

but something nags. it niggles and nags as you try to relax, try to enjoy being in your body but not of it. isn't it a luxury, to lay down in the middle of the day? tsk, i bet others more deserving would love to lay down in the middle of the day. and you can't even do that right, can you.  

staring at the tv,  
staring through the tv,  
staring through space, reality, time  
 
...are you even relaxing? stop thinking so much.  
or get up and do something.  
 
pace through the house, a lost specter,  
unable to touch anything, to act.  
 
just sit, relax. put on your favorite show, that'll help.  
 
<br>

...are you even watching? let's try your favorite episode.  
 
actually, never mind.  
why bother?  

if you're so restless, get up.  
back to pacing. searching, searching,  

.  

.  

.  

 
Search, then.  
 
Search for the answers you're hiding from yourself.  
 
Search in places you are terrified to look.  
 
Your shame is a beacon. Find all the places it has hidden.  
In memories, in dreams, in desires, in fears.  
 
Treat it with the gratitude it deserves.  

Cry at how fiercely it tried to protect you.  

Love it just as fiercely.  

<br>

Sigh together in relief, 
 
safe  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last. 

<br><br><br>

and yet,  
here i am,  
again and again  

i fear waking up five years, ten years from now,  
the exact same person  
in the exact same place  
with the exact same problems  
 
i look through old journals and i find my fears  
validated  
 
i sound exactly the same  
something's missing  
something's wrong with me  
i don't know who i am  
.  
.  
.  

i stopped writing. stopped reading, too.  
stopped doing anything, really.
