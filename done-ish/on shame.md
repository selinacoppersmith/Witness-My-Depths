*on shame*

The shame keeps you stuck, circling the same things, causing yourself more pain, more distress.  

It has teeth, it will bite down and cling to whatever it can.  
It is clinging for dear life.  
 
Do not try  
to pry open its jaw.  
 
Sing it to sleep. Run your fingers through its hair. Whisper, "shh, it's okay to rest now, sweetheart. I've got you,"  
 
It's just like you. It is you.  
 
The parts of you that hurt the most  
The parts of you that are the most ugly, most afraid  
The parts of you in need of the most tenderness  
 
And who will give it?
