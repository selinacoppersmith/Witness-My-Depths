*the airplane incident*  

for a long time i stopped wearing leggings or sweatpants to the airport.  

i was on a plane flying to or from somewhere with my dad. i took an edible before the flight. i’m not sure if i told him that. not sure if it was a secret. he would have been fine with it, i know.  

my dad had the window seat, i was in the middle. a stranger in the aisle seat next to me.
after takeoff i laid down on the tray table for a nap. i don’t know how much time had passed, but i woke up in the dark, disoriented.  

i felt rustling to my right. close to me. too close to me. touching me. a hand’s movement, near my hip, inching— i couldn’t believe it. i clenched my elbows in tight to my body, protecting, blocking passage. i thought there was no way this could possibly be happening, i must be… imagining. maybe the edible just made me paranoid.  

i spent the rest of the flight like that. questioning if what was happening was really happening. heart thumping in panic as i tried to convince myself that it wasn’t. that it was. as i tried to convince myself to say something. to move. my own dad was in the seat next to me. why couldn’t i bring myself to say something? why? why? why?  

a stranger was trying to work his hand into my pants, and i was frozen, muscles tight, battling with myself about reality.  

i said nothing. i did nothing. i wondered how many times he had tried to do this to before. if he has succeeded. how many more times he’d try again in the future. wondered what the fuck was wrong with me.

*its not your fault.*

*it’s just your body’s reaction. your nervous system.  
fight or flight.*

or freeze.  
fawn.

how… unfortunate.

how utterly disappointing.

i’m sorry.  

i would never say that to a friend.  

or a stranger.  

you couldn’t disappoint me, not for this.  
only the world that made it impossible to speak.
