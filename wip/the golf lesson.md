*the golf lesson*  

when i was maybe thirteen, and my sister maybe eight, my step-dad took us to the driving range for a golf lesson.   the instructor commented on my swing, gave me something to improve on. i understood what he wanted me to do, but was having trouble actually doing it.  

my sister was doing well.  

i was trying. getting frustrated as he told me the same thing over and over, as if i just wasn’t understanding.  
 it was my body that wasn’t understanding.  

i frustrated to tears, feeling like he thought i was stupid, incapable.  

my step-dad pulled me aside, asked what was wrong. he sounded sweet, even. caring. but i already knew to fear him. i already knew crying wasn’t allowed. couldn’t bring myself to say anything but *i don’t know*. also not allowed.  

he played at kind long enough for me to feel like it was my fault he was over it.  

we left not long after.  

the ride home was silent.  

when we got home, my brother was cleaning the living room. whether he was already cleaning or started at the sound of the garage, i don’t know.  

my step-dad told him he could stop. *pointed at me and said we have someone to do that for us now*.  

my mom told him i was on my period, to try and justify my behavior, smooth things over. lessen his wrath.  
it worked, sort of. i don’t know. he dropped my *maid of the house* designation, at least.
