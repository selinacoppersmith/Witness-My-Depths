*on sensations* 

*"let's just sit with that for a second, how does it feel in your body?"* 

um. i don't know, i'm sad? i feel... i don't know, like i want to cry?  

.  

my therapist insists doing "body scans" will help me get in touch with how i'm feeling. a mindfulness technique, to attune to your body's sensations.

*"just start with feeling your toes, what sensations do you notice?"* 

*"maybe you notice some tingling, maybe it feels a little warm,"*

i struggled with it for a long time. wasn't making sense to me, wasn't translating.  

but, some time has passed.  

not to brag, but i've become something of an expert,  
i have observed sensations of *walking outside to a beautiful sunny day, inexplicably braced for an acme piano to fall on my head.*
