*the first date*

on my first date with a boy, he picked me up from my house in his truck. he was taking us to see a movie. on the drive, he tells me he’s sorry if he’s quiet, that he’s nervous, doesn’t know what to talk about. i smile and tell him that’s what the radio is for, and turn the volume up without another word.  

i wonder if he saw it as a kind gesture or a sign of disinterest.  

at the theater, we watch inception. sort of. he watched inception, i assume. i couldn’t pay attention. we were holding hands, his grip was so tight that my entire hand was pins and needles. it stayed like that the entire movie, and i did nothing but suffer through it. i spent the entire time thinking about what to say, how to get out of the situation. it would be so easy, right? wouldn’t it? 

i can’t remember, but i’d like to think i at least attempted to gently wiggle free and he just didn’t get the hint, but… who can say.  

i think i picked up somewhere that telling someone they’re hurting you is hurtful. 

he wasn’t a bad guy.  
he was sweet,  
it wasn’t on purpose,  
it wasn’t a huge deal,  
movies aren’t that long anyway,  
and like,  
a decent amount of time has probably already passed at this point.  
right?  
what’s 15 more minutes?  
what’s 15 more minutes?  
what’s 15 more minutes?  

.  

when he dropped me off at home, he walked me to my door.  

the moment had arrived, the part where you’re supposed to kiss your date.  

i wasn’t sure i wanted to.  

but there he was, standing.  

he wasn’t a bad guy. he was sweet. kind, polite, chivalrous.  

i leaned in and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  

he deserved at least that, didn’t he?
