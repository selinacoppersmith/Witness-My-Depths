and yet,  
here i am,  
again and again

i fear waking up five years, ten years from now,  
the exact same person  
in the exact same place  
with the exact same problems

i look through old journals and i find my fears  
validated

i sound exactly the same  
something's missing  
something's wrong with me  
i don't know who i am  
.  
.  
.

i stopped writing. stopped reading, too.  
stopped doing anything, really.
